# Fake-News-Prediction
With the rise of digital media, the spread of fake news has become a major concern. This project implements a model to analyze news content and classify it as fake or real.This project focuses on detecting and predicting fake news using machine learning and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques.


ðŸ”§ Tech Stack :
Python,
NLP Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn,
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression,
Dataset: Fake News Dataset (Kaggle)

=> Work Flow
1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of labeled ne ws articles
(fake or real).
2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data
(stop words removal etc.)
3. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant
features from the text
4. Model Selection: Choose an ML
algorithm
5. Training: Train the model on the labeled dataset. 6.
Evaluation: Test the model's performance on a separate test set.
